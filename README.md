# Parkinson_predictor

Using python to predict Parkinson's disease using data on bio-medical voice measurements
Models used: SVM, Sequential Neural Network, RF Neural Network
Training data source : UCI ML Parkinson's disease dataset

Attributes in the dataset:
name - ASCII subject name and recording number

MDVP:Fo(Hz) - Average vocal fundamental frequency

MDVP:Fhi(Hz) - Maximum vocal fundamental frequency

MDVP:Flo(Hz) - Minimum vocal fundamental frequency

MDVP:Jitter(%),MDVP:Jitter(Abs),MDVP:RAP,MDVP:PPQ,Jitter:DDP - Several measures of variation in fundamental frequency

MDVP:Shimmer,MDVP:Shimmer(dB),Shimmer:APQ3,Shimmer:APQ5,MDVP:APQ,Shimmer:DDA - Several measures of variation in amplitude

NHR,HNR - Two measures of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice

status - Health status of the subject (one) - Parkinson's, (zero) - healthy

RPDE,D2 - Two nonlinear dynamical complexity measures

DFA - Signal fractal scaling exponent

spread1,spread2,PPE - Three nonlinear measures of fundamental frequency variation
