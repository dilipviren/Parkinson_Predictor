# Explanation of the various biomarkers used:

Fundamental Frequency (F0): F0 represents the rate at which the vocal folds vibrate and is perceived as voice pitch. It is typically measured in Hertz (Hz) and provides information about the vocal fold tension and vocal pitch range.

Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (HNR): HNR measures the ratio of harmonics (related to the fundamental frequency) to noise in the voice signal. It provides insights into the quality and clarity of the voice by assessing the presence of unwanted noise components.

Jitter: Jitter is a measure of the variation in the cycle-to-cycle length of vocal fold vibrations. It reflects the irregularities or perturbations in the voice signal and can indicate vocal fold instability or pathology.

Shimmer: Shimmer measures the variation in the amplitude of vocal fold vibrations from cycle to cycle. It provides information about voice stability and can indicate irregularities in vocal fold movement.

Formants: Formants are the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract during speech production. They play a crucial role in vowel sounds and contribute to speech intelligibility. Analyzing formants can help identify vowel quality and potential vocal tract abnormalities.

Spectral Analysis: Spectral analysis involves examining the frequency components of the voice signal. It provides information about voice quality, spectral energy distribution, and potential abnormalities or deviations from typical vocal characteristics.

Voice Perturbation Measures: Various perturbation measures, such as standard deviation of F0 (SDF0) or amplitude perturbation quotient (APQ), assess the irregularities or deviations in voice parameters and can indicate vocal instability or disorders.

Voice Range Profile: The voice range profile displays the phonation capabilities across different pitches and loudness levels. It helps evaluate the dynamic range and flexibility of the voice
