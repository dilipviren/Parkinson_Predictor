# Explanation of the various biomarkers used:

A multidimensional voice program (MDVP) refers to a software or system that captures and analyzes various parameters of human voice production. It is commonly used in fields such as speech pathology, linguistics, and voice research to study and assess voice quality, vocal disorders, and speech characteristics. By measuring and analyzing multiple parameters simultaneously, a multidimensional voice program provides a comprehensive evaluation of voice characteristics.

Fundamental Frequency (F0): F0 represents the rate at which the vocal folds vibrate and is perceived as voice pitch. It is typically measured in Hertz (Hz) and provides information about the vocal fold tension and vocal pitch range.

Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (HNR): HNR measures the ratio of harmonics (related to the fundamental frequency) to noise in the voice signal. It provides insights into the quality and clarity of the voice by assessing the presence of unwanted noise components.

Jitter: Jitter is a measure of the variation in the cycle-to-cycle length of vocal fold vibrations. It reflects the irregularities or perturbations in the voice signal and can indicate vocal fold instability or pathology. Jitter:DDP (Jitter, Discrete Difference of Phase) is a specific method for calculating jitter that examines the differences in phase between adjacent periods of vocal fold vibration. It is called "Discrete Difference of Phase" because it calculates the phase differences between consecutive periods. Higher jitter:DDP values indicate increased irregularity or perturbation in the vocal fold vibrations. It can be an indicator of vocal fold instability or potential voice disorders.

Shimmer: Shimmer is a measure used in voice analysis to quantify the cycle-to-cycle variation in the amplitude or intensity of vocal fold vibrations. It assesses the irregularities or perturbations in the intensity of the voice signal.Shimmer is calculated by analyzing the variation in the peak-to-peak amplitudes of consecutive vocal fold cycles. It provides insights into the stability and consistency of vocal fold vibrations, as well as potential abnormalities or deviations in voice production. There are different ways to calculate shimmer, including calculating the relative shimmer (expressed as a percentage) or absolute shimmer (expressed in dB or other units). Typically, shimmer values are calculated for multiple cycles and summarized using statistical measures such as mean or standard deviation. Higher shimmer values indicate increased irregularity or perturbation in the amplitude of vocal fold vibrations, suggesting potential voice instability or pathology. It can be caused by factors such as vocal fold nodules, muscle tension dysphonia, or vocal fold paralysis. Lower shimmer values indicate more stable and consistent vocal fold vibrations.

Voice Perturbation Measures: Various perturbation measures, such as standard deviation of F0 (SDF0) or amplitude perturbation quotient (APQ), assess the irregularities or deviations in voice parameters and can indicate vocal instability or disorders.
