# Test Reports on the different classifications algorithms used and models created.

# SVM : Support Vector Machine 

SVM gave a significant improvement in accuracy when using best parameters calculated with GridSearchCV

84.6% -> 94.3%

Parameters:(C=1000, break_ties=False, cache_size=200, class_weight=None, coef0=0.0,
    decision_function_shape='ovr', degree=3, gamma=1, kernel='rbf', max_iter=-1,
    probability=False, random_state=None, shrinking=True, tol=0.001,

# RF : Random Forest Classifier

Random Forest gave no measurable improvement in accuracy up to 14 decimal places and stagnated at 89.74358974358975 %.

Parameters : (bootstrap=True, ccp_alpha=0.0, class_weight=None,
                       criterion='gini', max_depth=85, max_features='auto',
                       max_leaf_nodes=None, max_samples=None,
                       min_impurity_decrease=0.0, min_impurity_split=None,
                       min_samples_leaf=2, min_samples_split=5,
                       min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0, n_estimators=200,

                       verbose=0, warm_start=False)

-> More extensive and optimized parameter selection is recommended.
-> RandomSearchCV may provide better results with Random Forest but has several drawbacks built into its random nature of selection.
